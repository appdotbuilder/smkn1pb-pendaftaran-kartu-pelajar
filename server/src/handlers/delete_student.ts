    // 1. Verify student exists by ID
    // 2. Execute DELETE query with WHERE id = $1
    // 3. Return true if deletion was successful
    // 4. Return false if student not found or deletion failed
    // 5. Handle any database constraints or errors
    // 6. Consider soft delete vs hard delete based on requirements
